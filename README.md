# Real-Time Player Tracking with YOLOv11 and ByteTrack

This project uses a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model to detect and track football players in real-time from a 15-second match clip. Each player is assigned a unique ID, and the system attempts to preserve this ID even if a player leaves and later re-enters the frame.
